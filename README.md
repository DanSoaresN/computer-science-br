# Universidade Brasileira Livre

The Universidade Brasileira Livre (translated as Free Brazilian University) is a project that is inspired by the Open Source Society University (OSSU). It is a supportive community of students of all levels who help each other and share their experiences and knowledge around different open-source curriculums. The goal of this project is to make high-quality education available for everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

## The importance of a Portuguese Speaking Community

OSSU is a great community for everyone, but as the British Council report says only 5% of Brazil's 211 million people can speak English. Portuguese is the ninth most spoken language in the world, and most of its speakers live in Brazil.

This outlines the importance of having a supportive Open Source Community that can reach people where Open Source Society University can't. A lot of work has been done to make free education of quality in Portuguese a reality for everyone.

## What curriculums actually does UBL have?

OSSU started with the Computer Science Curriculum, and we have done the same. But we have not only "translated" it. We have also adapted it to Brazilian Computer Science guidelines and reality. While MOOCs (Massive Open Source Courses) are not at all popular in Brazil, we have great resources from universities and teachers YouTube channels that we used to build it.

Our next goal is to release an even more comprehensive Mathematics Curriculum, building on the groundbreaking work we did in the first one. Our future vision is to build even more world-class curriculums in a variety of subject areas, and help grow and diversify our already amazing community, always with the same goal of democratizing education.

If you want to access our curriculums:

## Who is doing this?

Our project started out as a humble draft of a Computer Science Curriculum, but it has grown into a Community of more than one thousand participants on Discord, almost three thousand Twitter followers, and more than five thousand stars on Github. Along this journey, our project has had a lot of dedicated contributors who have helped us reach more people, and we're thankful to every single one of them!

Since the beginning of this journey, we have had an amazing team working tirelessly to improve and maintain the project. These four incredible contributors are the people who helped to orchestrate all of this work into what UBL is today:
